    "#### Problem Statement: You have a dataset, this is a raw dataset obtained from numerous properties in the UK. You are trying to create an algorithm to predict the heating load of a property. You do not need to understand the science behind heating loads, energy transfer etc. Try focus more on the data rather than the context, though, some context does help. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a real life situation, you will never get clean data. You will have anomalies, nulls, or data that just doesn't make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has been purposely edited to reflect some of that.\n",
    "- It has random data\n",
    "- Anomalies\n",
    "- Null values\n",
    "- Messy data in general\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to clean and explore this data using various data manipulation techniques in python that we will teach you. Once you have got the data to a good state, you can then pass it through a Machine Learning Model. This notebook is a skeleton of steps, with some hard steps taken for you, but feel free to change or manipulate any existing code to really understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps are as followed:\n",
    "- Clean and explore the data\n",
    "- Pass it through the Machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this, we will give each team a score, to see who did the best prediction model. Remember, its not just the model that affects how well you predict things. Data cleaning and manipulation play a massive role. So even if you dont want to understand the maths of a model, cleaning and manipulating data, makes all the difference. "
